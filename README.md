# Predictive Maintenance for Healthcare Equipment – Heart Disease Focus

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to perform predictive maintenance on healthcare equipment, with a special focus on devices used in **heart disease diagnosis and treatment** (e.g., ECG machines, defibrillators). By predicting both equipment failures and patient heart disease risks, this system enables **timely interventions**, improves **equipment uptime**, and enhances **patient outcomes**.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Predict heart disease using historical patient data.
- Anticipate equipment failure using machine learning models.
- Optimize maintenance schedules to reduce downtime.
- Integrate predictive models with clinical workflows.
- Improve overall care quality and equipment efficiency.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `NumPy` – data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` – model building & evaluation
  - `TensorFlow` / `Keras` – neural networks
  - `statsmodels` – logistic regression
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – visualization (optional)
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook / VSCode / PyCharm

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Dataset used: `heart.csv`
- Features include:
  - Age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol
  - Maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and more
- Target variable: Presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Clean missing values, normalize features.

2. **Modeling Approaches**
   - Neural Network using `TensorFlow/Keras`
   - Logistic Regression using `statsmodels`

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
   - Novelty and Diversity Scores (relevant to maintenance recommendations)

4. **Insights**
   - Logistic Regression achieved better F1-score.
   - The models also include metrics to assess diversity and novelty, useful for personalized maintenance scheduling.

## 📊 Results Summary

| Model               | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Neural Network      | 0.8276    | 0.7742 | 0.8000   |
| Logistic Regression | 0.8387    | 0.8387 | 0.8387   |

- Logistic Regression showed slightly better performance.
- Neural Network offered deeper representations and better adaptability for future real-time integration.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Real-time integration of sensor data from equipment
- Use of RNNs or CNNs for better accuracy
- Integration with hospital information systems
- Enhancing explainability with SHAP or LIME
- KPI dashboards for maintenance scheduling

---

## ✅ Advantages

- Improved **equipment reliability**
- Reduced **downtime and repair costs**
- Enhanced **diagnostic accuracy** for heart disease
- **Proactive** and **data-driven** maintenance scheduling
- Compliance with **safety standards** and regulations
